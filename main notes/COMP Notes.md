float volOfCilinder (radius, hight)
	float vol = (pi * radius^2 * hight)
	return vol

ask user the hight and radius of the cylinder
define variable h to be the hight of the cylinder
define variable r to be the radius of the cylinder
define variable r2 to be r times r
define variable volume to be pi times r2 times h
return volume
